  abstract = "We introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process
              droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing data, which performs
              cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier
              deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode
              whitelisting. Alevin9s approach to UMI deduplication accounts for
              both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes.
              This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard
              gene-ambiguous reads, and improves the accuracy of gene abundance
              estimates. Alevin is written in C++14, and is integrated into the
              salmon tool available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon.",
